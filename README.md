INFO697-FinalProject

A Mean Solar Day is an experiment with the visualization of time-series data on the quantified self. Using daylight data obtained from an Adafruit Feather Huzzah ESP8266 microcontroller with a photoresistor light sensor module, and a personal record of my activities over the same day, 17 September 2020, this prototype aims to determine if an alteration in the visualization of time-series data can provide greater insights into how the quantity of daylight experienced in my affected my behavior patterns for that day.
